## Why MetricChat?

Most AI analytics tools are glorified SQL generators. MetricChat is a full analytics agent — it remembers your data, follows your rules, and shows its work.

<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Memory & Context

The agent builds a semantic understanding of your data down to the table and column level. It learns terminology, business logic, and usage patterns over time — so queries get smarter with every conversation.

<td width="50%">

### Rules & Guardrails

Define instructions, approved terms, and constraints with versioning and approval workflows. Sync rules from git to auto-index dbt models, markdown docs, and code — so the AI always stays within bounds.

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Full Observability

Every agent decision is traced — plans, tool calls, guardrail checks, LLM judge evaluations, and user feedback. Debug any answer. Improve the loop continuously.

<td width="50%">

### Dashboards & Sharing

Build and share dashboards from conversations. Save queries to a searchable catalog. Give your team a single place for trusted, reusable analytics.

<td width="50%">

### Any LLM, Any Warehouse

OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama — connected to Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, Redshift, and 20+ more. Swap or combine providers without breaking workflows.

### MCP Support

Use MetricChat from Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other AI clients via the Model Context Protocol — while reliably tracking every request and data operation.

## How It Works

```
You ask a question
  -> MetricChat agent plans an approach
    -> Pulls relevant context (memory, rules, schema)
    -> Writes and executes SQL against your warehouse
    -> Validates results against guardrails
    -> Returns an answer with full trace
      -> Builds memory for next time
```

Every step is observable. Every decision is logged. Nothing is a black box.
